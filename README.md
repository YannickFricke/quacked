# Quacked

Create maintainable redux state slices!

## About the project

What sound does the duck make? QUACK!

We all know the problem - splitting everything we need for our redux store across different files.

For that [Erik Rasmussen](https://github.com/erikras) formed the term "redux ducks", where all actions, action creators
and the corresponding reducer are defined in a single file.

Sadly most of the libraries out there are written in JavaScript - a thing where TypeScript can't help you with type definitions.

Quacked got you covered for this problem!
